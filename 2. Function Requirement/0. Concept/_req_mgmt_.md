### MANAGEMENT OF REQUIREMENT

###### NEEDS INITIATIVE ASESSMENT

Requirements are initiated at the portfolio, program, and/or project level and are synchronized throughout the life cycle into a product, service, or result that is intended to meet those requirements and provide business value.

Portfolio-Level Activities:
* Develop Portfolio Strategic Plan: Conveys the alignment of the portfolio components to the organizational strategy, future benefit, and stakeholder expectations. The portfolio strategic plan conveys the key strategic assumptions, constraints, dependencies, and priorities that influence the requirements.
* Define Portfolio Road-map: Provides insight to the strategic prioritization mapping of the portfolio and its components. The roadmap is the initial basis upon which dependencies between initiatives and deliverables are established. The roadmap should provide context for requirements efforts on the project.

Program-Level Activities:
* Define Business Case or Equivalent: Provides insight into alternative solution options, time to market, constraints, and philosophy behind the business need. It also contains a clear vision statement for the initiative, identifies an initial set of known stakeholders and their needs, and identifies any constraints or dependencies.
* Develop Program Plan: Assists the component projects with detailed planning. During program planning, external influences, organizational constraints, and business strategies influence the requirements outlined in the program plan.
* Develop Program Roadmap: Provides high-level timeline, benefits, and strategy that the project is sexpected to accomplish. Major milestones from the component projects are typically included in the program roadmap. Requirements are monitored to ensure they continue to address the needs of the program and/or portfolio.
* Create Benefits Register: Collects and lists the planned benefits for the program. It defines the appropriate performance measures for each of the benefits. The benefits register includes the person, group, or organization responsible for delivering each of the benefits.
* Engage Stakeholders: Maintains stakeholder involvement across the initiative. A stakeholder analysis is conducted to identify and understand the needs of the stakeholders. Stakeholder preferences, characteristics, and expectations influence requirements-planning decisions.
* Develop Benefits Realization Plan: Defines when a benefit is delivered by a program or project. This plan defines the benefits and how they are achieved. There are defined metrics and procedures to measure the benefits, to describe how the resulting capability is transitioned to an operational state, and to describe how the organization can sustain the benefits.

Project-Level Activities:
* Develop Business Case: Is normally developed before project initiation. The needs assessment and business case build the foundation for determining the project objectives.
* Document and Communicate Results: Aligns with the portfolio strategic plan and program plan, and thus should be communicated with the sponsor and other appropriate stakeholders.

4 Assessment Techniques:
* SWOT Analysis: SWOT analysis becomes more detailed at the project level and more strategic at the portfolio or program level, and may be used to understand the strengths and weaknesses and opportunities and threats of the organization.
* Decision Analysis: Decision analysis is a group of techniques that provides a basis for structured, analytical decision making. Decision trees (yes/no) and decision tables depicts a series of decisions and their outcomes.
* Gap Analysis: Gap analysis is a technique used to compare the current assessment of organizational capability against a future desired state.
* Benchmarking: Benchmarking provides insights into how other organizations are responding to the same challenges experienced by the performing organization. Benchmarking is used to compare organization actual and planned practices, such as processes and operations, to those of comparable organizations.

###### REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PLANNING

Requirement planning provides guidance and direction on how requirements will be developed and managed throughout the project. The plan is developed, reviewed, and updated to reflect the specific activities of the life cycle domains from elicitation, analysis, monitoring, and controlling through solution evaluation.
