Other great sources of information about an industry are suppliers who sell to the industry, sales representatives, equipment manufacturers, brokerage firm analysts, wholesalers, distributors, and retailers.  Be sure and identify voids in the market which are currently not served, and which the company presumably will be filling.

> **Target Market Strategy**  
Explain strategy for defining the target market. Describe the unmet needs of target customers that the product /service fulfills or the problems that it solves.

> **Marketing and Sales Forecasts**  
Based on previous customer, competitor, and market analyses, develop marketing expense, sales expense, sales volume, and revenue forecasts for the planning horizon (usually 5 years).

###### OPERATIONS
The Operations section outlines how to run the business and deliver value to customers. Operations is defined as the processes used to deliver products and services to the marketplace and can include manufacturing, transportation, logistics, travel, printing, consulting, after-sales service, and so on. In all likelihood, about 80% of expenses will be for operations,  80% of employees will be working in operations, and 80% of time will be spent on operating problems and opportunities. Be sure to carefully link the design of operations to marketing plan. For example, if high quality will be one of the company's competitive advantages in the marketplace, then design operations to deliver high quality, not low costs. Remember that the company will probably have to make trade-offs with operations. It is impossible to have the lowest costs, highest quality, best on-time performance, and most flexibility in industry all at the same time. Often, higher quality means higher costs, lower costs means less variety and less flexibility. Be careful how the company make these trade-offs so that it can deliver products to the market in accordance with marketing plan.

> **Operations Strategy**  
In this subsection, describe how to fulfill marketing strategy using operations: How will the company use operations to add value for customers in current target market? How to win in the marketplace on the dimensions of cost, quality, timeliness, and flexibility? Which dimensions will the company stress and which will it de-emphasize?

> **Scope of Operation**  
Describe the scope of operations. Include details in an appendix, as necessary. What will the company do in-house and what will it purchase (make vs. buy?) Why does this make sense for the business?  What will be the relationship with vendors, suppliers, partners, and associates? What kind of people will the company need to hire?

> **Ongoing Operations**  
How will the company operate on an ongoing basis? Include detail in an appendix, as necessary.

> **Operating Expenses**  
Include a description of the operating costs and assumptions that appear in the financial statements.

###### DEVELOPMENT
This section will outline how the company intend to ramp-up its business. This section is often woefully under-developed in many business plans. Assuming the company have a dynamic marketing plan and customers do indeed come flocking for product or service, the company must be able to deliver it to them. The Development section is a road map of how to get from where we are now to where we want to be in the future. At the start of a business, what are all of the steps that the company need to accomplish to get  business up and running? If the business is expanding, what do we need to do to make it grow? These steps can be as routine as securing retail space, or as critical as applying for and getting a patent on key technology. Don't go into too much detail here.  For example, the need to get business cards printed probably does not belong in a development plan (although you might include it in a detailed checklist in the appendices).

> **Development Strategy**  
What work remains to launch the company and products? What factors need to come together to make the concept work? What are we doing to bring them together? What are the risks to the successful implementation of development plans? Are they technological risks (e.g., we can’t make our product work)? Cost risks (e.g., it costs more than we figured)? Competitive risks (e.g., we are preempted in the market by a competitor)? How will we mitigate these risks?

> **Development Timeline**  
What is the timetable for launching the company and its products? (Consider adding a chart or table here?) Go out as far in the future as plans.

> **Development Expenses**  
Include here a description of the development costs and assumptions that appear in financial statements.

###### MANAGEMENT
Venture capitalists often assert that there are three attributes important for a successful start-up business: management, management, and management. Many venture capitalist claim they will invest in a strong management team with a mediocre idea, but will decline to fund a weak management team with a great idea. Highlight accomplishments and capabilities while mitigating any obvious shortcomings or weaknesses. For example, if the employees are young and inexperienced, accentuate energy, capacity for hard work, and willingness to learn, while downplaying lack of experience.

> **Company Organization**  
Describe how the company will be organized. What does the organization chart look like? What is the ownership structure of the company? Will we have a board of directors? Who will be on it? What will be their role?

> **Management Team**  
Describe the founders and principal managers who will run the company. Who are the key managers? (Include resumes in the Appendix) What will be their duties and responsibilities? What unique skills do they bring to the venture? How will they be compensated? What additions to the management team do we plan? When?

> **Administrative Expenses**  
Include here a description of administrative expenses that appear in financial statements.

###### SUMMARY OF FINANCIALS
It is important to have strong, well constructed financials. If the company does not have a great concept to make (lots of) money, shareholders will quickly lose interest. To construct financials, the company should start with development and operations plan to create a schedule or timetable of development and operational activities. From these development activities, company can then create cash-flow projections, income statements, and pro forma balance sheets for at least three years into the future, and sometimes five. As a rule of thumb, the financial projections should extend far enough into the future to the point where business has achieved stable operations. The first year of financial statement projections should be month-by-month since cash flows are critical in the early stages of any startup. Second and third year financial statements should be quarterly, and fourth and fifth years should be annual. If possible, it is useful to include best case, expected case, and worse case scenarios with the company's financials. Be sure that the financial projections are in congruence with the other sections of the plan.

The Summary of Financials section should be a discussion and description of company financial projections -- put the actual financial spreadsheets in the Appendices. Describe the timing and amount of investment that will be required to achieve the plans.  Then demonstrate that this investment is a good one by showing that profits, assets, and ROI are all favorable as the business progresses.

> **Financial Assumptions**  
What assumptions to be made in putting together financial forecasts?  Summarize here – include detail in an appendix, if required.

> **Financial Forecasts**  
Summarize the financial forecasts. Include detailed statements in appendices, including cash flow and income statements, and balance sheets. Generally, included statements for 5 years into the future. The first year should include forecasts by month, the second year should include quarterly forecasts, and the final three years should be annual forecasts. You may also wish to include other financial documents such as a break-even analysis, valuation calculations, et cetera. You may also wish to include best case, expected case, and worst case scenarios.

> **Capital Requirements**  
How much new capital does company need?  What is the timetable for new capital infusion? How much do the company need?

> **Financial Risks**  
What financial risks are inherent in the plan?  How do you plan to minimize these risks? How will you avoid financial pitfalls? What is the worst-case scenario and how will the company respond?

> **Exit Strategies**  
What is the preferred exit strategy? Go public? Sell out? Operate and grow? What is the exit strategy if business does not develop as hoped? How can we get out?

###### OFFERING
The Offering (or Funding Request) is where you make your pitch for money.  If you have decided to seek equity capital, then you need to offer a potential investor (F&F, VC, angel, alliance partner) a specified piece of your company in return for a specific amount of money. If you are seeking a loan, then you need to request a potential lender (F&F, bank, customer) for a specific amount of money in return for a specific return.  In either case, it is important that you be specific with your funding needs, that you clearly spell out and sell the advantages of your proposal to the investor, and make it clear how investors can eventually get their money back out of your venture.  Also, it is important that you persuade investors that the deal you are offering is fair to them and is supported by the facts.  Finally, remember that everything is open to negotiation, so don't give away the farm on the first round!

> **Investment Requirements**  
Using your cashflow analysis, what investments do we require to achieve our plans?  What is the timing?

> **Valuation of Business**  
What is the current value of our company?  How do we calculate this value?

> **Offer**  
What is the structure of the deal we are offering or seeking? How much money do we want? How much of the company are we willing to give away? How much interest are we willing to pay? What collateral do we have for a loan? What is the planned exit strategy for investors? What is the anticipated return on investment for investors?
