### BUSINESS MODEL STRATEGY

###### BUSINESS MODEL ENVIRONMENT

Business models are designed and executed in specific environments. That is why developing a good understanding of the organization environment helps to conceive stronger and more competitive business models.

Continuous environmental scanning is important because of the growing complexity of economic landscape, great uncertainty and severe market disruptions. Understanding changes in the environment helps adapt the model more effectively.

We may conceive the external environment as a design space, which does not limit creativity or predefine business model, but influence design choices and help make more informed decisions.

There are 4 main areas of the environments: (1) market forces, (2) industry forces, (3) key trends, and (4) macroeconomic forces.
