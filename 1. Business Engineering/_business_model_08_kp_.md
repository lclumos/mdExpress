###### KEY PARTNERSHIPS - KP
The Key Partnerships Building Block describes the network of suppliers and partners that make the business model work.

Company forge partnerships for many reasons, and partnerships are becoming a cornerstone of many business models. Companies create alliances to optimize their business models, reduce risk, or acquire resources. There are 4 types of partnerships: (1) Strategic alliances between non-competitors, (2) Coopetition: strategic partnerships between competitors, (3) Joint ventures to develop new businesses, and (4) Buyer-supplier relationships to assure reliable supplies.

Motivations for creating partnerships:
* Optimization and economy of scale: Optimize the allocation of resources and activities. It is illogical for a company to own all resources or perform every activity by itself. Optimization and economy of scale partnerships are usually formed to reduce costs, and often involve outsourcing or sharing infrastructure.
* Reduction of risk and uncertainty: Reduce risk in a competitive environment characterized by uncertainty. It is not unusual for competitors to form a strategic alliance in one area while competing in another.
* Acquisition of particular resources and activities: Extend the company's own capabilities by relying on other firms to furnish particular resource or perform certain activities. Such partnerships can be motivated by needs to acquire knowledge, licenses, or access to customers (i.e. insurer may choose to rely on independent brokers to sell its policies rather than develop its own sales force etc.)
