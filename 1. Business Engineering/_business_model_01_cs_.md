###### CUSTOMER SEGMENTS - CS
The Customer Segments Building Block defines different groups of people and/or organizations that the enterprise aims to reach and serve.

Customer Segments are grouped by common needs, behaviors, or other attributes. A business model may define one or several large or small Customer Segments. Certain segments are more critical than the others and the enterprise must make concise decisions on which segments to serve, and which to ignore.

Customer groups represent separate segments if:  
* Their needs require and justify a distinct offer
* They are reached through different Distribution Channels
* They require different types of relationships
* They have substantially different profitabilities
* They are willing to pay for different aspects of the offer

Examples of Customer Segments:
* Mass Market: Focus on one large group of customers with broadly similar needs and problems.
* Niche Market:Target markets cater to specific Customer Segments, Value Propositions, Distribution Channels and Customer Relationships.
* Segmented: Distinguish between market segments with slightly different needs and problems (customer's income, interests etc.)
* Diversified: Serve very different Customer Segments with completely distinct needs and problems (i.e. Amazon with cloud computing vs. retails)
* Multi-sided platforms: Serve two or more interdependent Customer Segments.
