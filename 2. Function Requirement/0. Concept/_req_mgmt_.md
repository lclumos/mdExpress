### MANAGEMENT OF REQUIREMENT

###### NEEDS INITIATIVE ASSESSMENT

Requirements are initiated at the portfolio, program, and/or project level and are synchronized throughout the life cycle into a product, service, or result that is intended to meet those requirements and provide business value.

Portfolio-Level Activities:
* Develop Portfolio Strategic Plan: Conveys the alignment of the portfolio components to the organizational strategy, future benefit, and stakeholder expectations. The portfolio strategic plan conveys the key strategic assumptions, constraints, dependencies, and priorities that influence the requirements.
* Define Portfolio Road-map: Provides insight to the strategic priority mapping of the portfolio and its components. The road-map is the initial basis upon which dependencies between initiatives and deliverables are established. The road-map should provide context for requirements efforts on the project.

Program-Level Activities:
* Define Business Case or Equivalent: Provides insight into alternative solution options, time to market, constraints, and philosophy behind the business need. It also contains a clear vision statement for the initiative, identifies an initial set of known stakeholders and their needs, and identifies any constraints or dependencies.
* Develop Program Plan: Assists the component projects with detailed planning. During program planning, external influences, organizational constraints, and business strategies influence the requirements outlined in the program plan.
* Develop Program Road-map: Provides high-level time-line, benefits, and strategy that the project is expected to accomplish. Major milestones from the component projects are typically included in the program road-map. Requirements are monitored to ensure they continue to address the needs of the program and/or portfolio.
* Create Benefits Register: Collects and lists the planned benefits for the program. It defines the appropriate performance measures for each of the benefits. The benefits register includes the person, group, or organization responsible for delivering each of the benefits.
* Engage Stakeholders: Maintains stakeholder involvement across the initiative. A stakeholder analysis is conducted to identify and understand the needs of the stakeholders. Stakeholder preferences, characteristics, and expectations influence requirements-planning decisions.
* Develop Benefits Realization Plan: Defines when a benefit is delivered by a program or project. This plan defines the benefits and how they are achieved. There are defined metrics and procedures to measure the benefits, to describe how the resulting capability is transitioned to an operational state, and to describe how the organization can sustain the benefits.

Project-Level Activities:
* Develop Business Case: Is normally developed before project initiation. The needs assessment and business case build the foundation for determining the project objectives.
* Document and Communicate Results: Aligns with the portfolio strategic plan and program plan, and thus should be communicated with the sponsor and other appropriate stakeholders.

4 Assessment Techniques:
* SWOT Analysis: SWOT analysis becomes more detailed at the project level and more strategic at the portfolio or program level, and may be used to understand the strengths and weaknesses and opportunities and threats of the organization.
* Decision Analysis: Decision analysis is a group of techniques that provides a basis for structured, analytical decision making. Decision trees (yes/no) and decision tables depicts a series of decisions and their outcomes.
* Gap Analysis: Gap analysis is a technique used to compare the current assessment of organizational capability against a future desired state.
* Benchmarking: Benchmarking provides insights into how other organizations are responding to the same challenges experienced by the performing organization. Benchmarking is used to compare organization actual and planned practices, such as processes and operations, to those of comparable organizations.

###### REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PLANNING

Requirement planning provides guidance and direction on how requirements will be developed and managed throughout the project. The plan is developed, reviewed, and updated to reflect the specific activities of the life cycle domains from elicitation, analysis, monitoring, and controlling through solution evaluation.

Requirement Management Planning - Success Factors
* Organization Commitment: The requirements process should be aligned with organizational goals and values, and a sponsor should be engaged.
* Recognizing the Value of Requirement Management Planning: Requirements management planning should be recognized as a valuable domain that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational management, stakeholders, project managers, and team members.
* Stakeholder Engagement and Collaboration: Stakeholder analysis is often conducted during the planning domain so that the project team can understand the stakeholder impacts and influences on the requirements process as early as possible.
* Integration with Project Management Activities: Requirements development and management do not exist in isolation from other project management processes. A successful requirements plan requires integrated execution with the project management plan.

Requirement Management Planning - Activities
* Stakeholder Analysis and Engagement: Stakeholder analysis and engagement is critical to the success of requirements management plan. Further stakeholder identification is conducted during requirements planning activities to set expectations with the key stakeholders to ensure they understand the requirements activities that will be performed.
[1] Generate or Refine the Stakeholder Register: An initial stakeholder register may have been developed as a part of the needs assessment, or the work to produce the project management plan, stakeholder management plan, communications plan, or other plan documents. The register may include stakeholders such as those who will provide sponsorship for the projects, benefit from the project outcomes, be responsible for the project outcomes, define the product service or result, provide support, articulate the benefits, provide financial backing, use the solution, and implement the solution.   
[2] Group and Characterize Stakeholders: Once the stakeholder register is complete, an analysis of the characteristics of the identified stakeholders should be performed. Some commonly applied characteristics for consideration are attitude, complexity, culture, experience, level of influence, location, and availability. It is important to make sure that there are clear roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities. A commonly used approach to organizing these assignments, known as either RACI or ACRI, characterizes and groups stakeholders into one or more of 4 categories: Responsible (perform the work) - Accountable (approve the work) - Consulted (to be asked for opinions) - Informed (apprise progress).  
[3] Management Stakeholder Engagement: Through proactive communication and working directly with stakeholders to meet the project objectives, stakeholders are engaged and managed throughout the requirements life cycle process.  
* Requirements Management Planning Initiation: It is essential at the start of the requirements process to clearly understand the initial project scope statement and project objectives.
[1] Gather Project Information: Information can be leveraged to provide the context for the scope statement which may include (but not limited to): organizational strategic plans, feasibility studies, needs assessments, business cases, concept of operations documents, program management plan (when applicable), project charter, project management plan, project scope statement, contractual documents, and customer specifications.   
[2] Identify Organizational Standards and Guidance: Organizations establish operating procedures, standards, and pre-developed tools, templates, techniques, and process documents.  
* Develop the Requirements Management Plan: Requirements management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how the requirement activities of the project will be planned and managed. The project life cycle strong influences how requirements are planned, developed, and managed.
[1] Core components of the Requirements Management Plan: This plan focuses on the scope of requirements activities to be conducted and deliverables to be produced. The core components of the requirements management plan can include (but not limited to): How requirements should be developed, tracked, managed, validated, and reported; what roles and responsibilities are for those participating in requirements activities; what the authorization and key decision-making process is; how requirements should be prioritized, approved, and maintained; how acceptance criteria are determined for the requirements and solutions; what product metrics are used and the rationale for using them; what the traceability structure is and the implementation to reflect which requirement attributes will be captured on the traceability matrix; and how requirements will be documented and communicated to stakeholders.  
* Launch the Requirements Management Plan: Once the requirements management plan is complete, it should be reviewed with key stakeholders to reduce the risk of stakeholders failing to support the work to be performed. There may be an organizational or project life cycle process that defines how approval should be attained.

###### REQUIREMENT ELICITATION

Elicitation is a discovery process used to bring forward or produce information relevant to the project or program by drawing out information from stakeholders and other sources. The process aims to identify the causes of the business problem or the reasons for addressing an opportunity, as well as the information to be used to derive a sufficient level of requirements to enable a solution to be developed and implemented.

Requirements Elicitation Success Factors
* Planning and Preparation: Within requirements elicitation, planning focuses on how to conduct elicitation sessions, which stakeholders to involve, and in which order. The size, complexity, and type of project should be considered, as the elicitation activities will vary based on these characteristics.
* Active Stakeholder Engagement: Stakeholders are a principal source of requirements, which places them at the center of many project and program issues related to unrealistic expectations, lack of user involvement, and ambiguous, unclear requirements.
* Defined Business/Organizational Need: A properly conducted needs assessment lays the foundation for achieving the goals and objectives of the business or organization. A comprehensive understanding of the business need, problem, or opportunity helps to determine that the right information is elicited and the appropriate stakeholders and elicitation techniques to obtain that information are selected.
* Domain Knowledge: The person responsible for elicitation should competent in the domain or have access to subject matter experts for support so as to ask the right questions during elicitation activities.

Requirements Elicitation Activities
* Plan for Elicitation: Before the actual elicitation, more detailed preparation is required such as drafting agendas, scheduling conferences for elicitation workshops, inviting stakeholders etc.
[1] Activities: Derive from Requirements Management Planning, but now that more is known about the problem/opportunity, the techniques should be revisited.  
[2] Requirements Sources: Determine the potential sources of information that are needed to develop requirements. These sources can be internal or external to the organization and include specific people, reference material, or other documentation relevant to the project or program scope. This information may exist in many forms, including user manuals, procedures, market research, or governmental regulations.  
[3] Resources: Identify project resources including stakeholders, equipment, and facilities.  
[4] Expected Deliverables: Derive from Requirements Management Planning, but to be revisited because more is now known about the problem/opportunity to be solved or addressed. More predictive life cycles typically require formal requirements specifications, whereas highly adaptive life cycles focus on more lightweight documentation, such as user stories.  
* Define Types of Requirements: These categories help define what information needs to be elicited and the source of that information.
[1] Business Requirements: Describe the high-level needs of the overall organization to address a problem or opportunity. These requirements provide the rationale for why a project or program is launched.  
[2] Stakeholder Requirements: Express the needs of a specific stakeholder or group of stakeholders, which may include customers, users, or suppliers. These requirements communicate the material interest or the stakeholders in the outcome of the product, service, or result.  
[3] Solution Requirements: Describe the features and functions that the product, service or results needs to exhibit to satisfy the business and stakeholder requirements. Solution requirements may include requirements related to technology and standard compliance. These are usually grouped into 2 categories: functional and nonfunctional requirements.  
[4] Transition Requirements: Describe the temporary capabilities that are essential to migrate from the current state to future state environment. Requirements that fall into this category include conversion of data from the current system and training needed to address skill gaps.  
[5] Project Requirements: Describe the actions, processes, and other conditions that the project needs to satisfy. These requirements focus on the execution of the work required to deliver the solution.  
[6] Quality Requirements: Describe the criteria needed to ensure completion of project deliverables and demonstrate compliance with identified standards and quality Metrics.  
[7] Program Requirements: Describe the specifications and outcomes for successful implementation and delivery of the program benefits.  
* Conduct Elicitation Activities: Elicitation is an exploratory activity that draws out implicit and hidden information. Input is received by consulting a broad range of stakeholders as well as reviewing existing systems, historical records and documentation.
* Document and Communicate Results: The outcome of elicitation activities should be recorded to properly examine and synthesize the relevant information during the analysis process. It is important to document the results, consolidate and communicate with stakeholders to ensure accuracy. These work products may or may not evolve into requirements. However they are necessary throughout the elicitation process to clarify the information received and identify other items that require additional research or explanation.

Requirement Elicitation Techniques
* Interviews: Methodical approach used to elicit information from stakeholders by asking relevant questions and documenting the responses.
* Facilitated Workshops: Focused and structured session to identify requirements, reconcile differences, and reach consensus among the participants.
* Focus Groups: Focus groups assemble participants such as subject matter experts, in a group setting to share their attitudes and expectations about a particular product, service, or result.
* Brainstorming: Group technique used to generate multiple ideas related to a particular subject.
* Questionnaires and Surveys: Techniques used to quickly solicit and obtain information from a large number of users.
* Document Analysis: A substantial amount of information can be uncovered by reviewing and analyzing existing documentation. Document analysis inspects a wide range of materials, such as a glossary of terms, strategic and business plans, process flows, problem/issue logs, regulations, policies, and procedures to discover and/or verify requirements.
* Interface Analysis: This technique is used to define requirements by examining system interactions between users, processes and other system components. It helps to establish relationships and boundaries by determining the input and output needs of each interfacing system.
* Prototypes: Method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a working model of the expected product before actual development.
* Observation: Observation is also known as "job shadowing", provides a direct way of viewing people in their environment to see how they perform their jobs or tasks.

###### REQUIREMENT CONTROLLING AND MONITORING

Requirement monitoring and controlling domain iteratively monitors the status of requirements and manages the requirements baseline over the project life cycle. The process and related activities involved in the development and management of requirements are distinct from the project management life cycle.

The requirements traceability matrix and associated attributes created during elicitation and analysis are applied in requirements monitoring to help control product and project scope. Traceability is updated as changes are approved. Approved requirements are base-lined and tracked, to include linkages among parent and child requirements. As new requirements are identified, they are assessed for impacts to the project and product and presented to stakeholders for approval.

Requirements instability is a leading cause of scope creep, and the requirements monitoring and controlling activities ensure that requested changes to requirements are processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process.

Traceability provides the ability to track product requirements from their origin to the activities and deliverables that satisfy them. Traceability is "bidirectional" or "forward and backward". Not all projects require the same amount of traceability documentation, so the specific deliverables that are traceable for the project are determined during requirement management planning.

Requirements Monitoring and Controlling Success Factors

###### SOLUTION EVALUATION

Solution Evaluation is the domain of business analysis concerned with activities performed to validate a solution that is about to be or that has already been implemented. Evaluation determines how well a solution meets the business needs expressed by stakeholders, including delivering value to customer. Evaluation of an implemented solution can also identify new or changed requirements that may lead to solution refinement or new solutions.

Testing, analysis and other means of demonstrating that the agreed-upon requirements have been met (verification activities) work alongside activities that demonstrate the suitability of the solution for its intended purpose (validation activities).

Solution Evaluation Success Factors
* Approach Evaluation as a Process:

Solution Evaluation Activities
* Plan for Evaluation:
* Validation During Solution Evaluation:
* Document and Communicate Results:

Solution Evaluation Techniques
* Solicit Inputs:

###### PROJECT OR PHASE CLOSURE

The outcomes of solution evaluation activities lead to a go/no-go decision, and if a go decision is reached, sign-off of the solution is obtained.

Evaluating the long-term performance of the solution is part of assessing the business benefits realized by implementing the solution.

Project or phase closure is the process of finalizing all activities across all of the Project Management Process Groups to formally complete the project or phase. Closure may include (1) documenting lessons learned and providing knowledge transfer, (2) supporting transition to operations and (3) enabling the organization to sustain long-term performance benefits over time.

Activities necessary for administrative closure of the program, project or iteration, including:
* Activities necessary to satisfy completion or exit criteria for the program, project, or iteration, including the evaluation of the acceptance criteria performed during the solution evaluation domain.
* Activities necessary to transfer the product, service, or result to the next program, project, or iteration or to production and/or operations.
* Activities necessary to collect project or iteration records, audit project success or failure, gather lessons learned, and archive related information for future use by the organization.
