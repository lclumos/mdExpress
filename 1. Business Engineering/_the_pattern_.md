### BUSINESS MODEL PATTERN

###### UNBUNDLING BUSINESS MODEL

There are 3 fundamentally different types of businesses: (1) Customer Relationship businesses, (2) Product Innovation businesses, and (3) Infrastructure businesses. Each type has different economic, competitive, and cultural imperatives.

Customer Relationship businesses find and acquire customers and build relationships with them.
Product Innovation businesses develop new and attractive products and services.
Infrastructure businesses build and manage platforms for high volume, repetitive tasks.

The three types may co-exist within a single corporation, but ideally they are unbundled into separate entities in order to avoid conflicts or undesirable trade-offs. The company should focus on one of three value disciplines: operational excellence, product leadership, or customer intimacy. Because each type of business is driven by different factors, they can conflict with each other or produce undesirable trade-offs within the same organization.
