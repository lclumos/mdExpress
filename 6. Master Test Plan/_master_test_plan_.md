# MASTER TEST PLAN

###### DOCUMENTATION RECORDS OF CHANGE
Provide information on how the development and distribution of the Test Case Specification will be controlled and tracked. Use the table below to provide the version number, the date of the version, the author/owner of the version, and a brief description of the reason for creating the revised version

| Criteria | Information |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Document Version | **v1.0** |
| System Version | **v1.0** |
| Latest Information Date | 1-AUG-2018 |

###### APPROVALS
The undersigned acknowledge that they have reviewed the Test Case Specification and agree with the information presented within this document. Changes to this Test Case Specification will be coordinated with, and approved by, the undersigned, or their designated representatives.  

###### INTRODUCTION
Provide full identifying information for the automated system, application, or situation for which the Test Case Specification applies, including as applicable, identification number(s), title(s)/name(s),
abbreviation(s)/acronym(s), part number(s), version number(s), and release number(s). Summarize the purpose of the document, the scope of activities that resulted in its development, the intended audience for the document, and expected evolution of the document. Also describe any security or privacy considerations associated with use of the Test Case Specification.

This document is a template for creating a Test Case Specification for a given investment or project. The final document should be delivered in an electronically searchable format. The Test Case Specification should stand on its own with all elements explained and acronyms spelled out for reader/reviewers.

###### OVERVIEW
Briefly describe the purpose and context for the system or situation, and summarize the history of its development. Include the high-level context diagram(s) for the system and subsystems previously provided in the High-Level Technical Design Concept/Alternatives, Requirements Document, and/or System Design Document (SDD), updated as necessary to reflect any changes that have been made based on more current information or understanding. If the high-level context diagram has been updated, identify the changes that were made and why.

###### DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE
> **Master Test Plan**  
High level overview of the entire plan on testing the system, application, or situation for which the Test Case Specification applies to. The plan is divided into 2 main dimensions, which are functional and non-functional.

> **Test Plan**  
Each plan dimension is further separated into different levels. Each level slides and views the dimension from a different perspective. Each test plan consists of many different test suite.

> **Test Suite**  
Test cases that are related to one another may be grouped into a test suite, so that they can be tested and verified together. Either the input of one test case could be the output of another, or different steps of the same business and/or operation procedure, or testing these test cases together delivers great convenience.  

> **Test Case**  
Specific step or situation to attain perceivable results. Each test case has its own implementation, and must consist of, and not limit to: pre-conditions, execution steps, post-Conditions and expected results. The details of a test case is its specification.   
Provide an overview of the test cases/scripts that will be executed. List each test case/script by its project-unique identifier and title. Test cases/scripts may be grouped by test function (e.g., user acceptance testing, Section 508 testing, system testing, regression testing, etc.). If test case/script information is maintained in an automated tool, this information may be exported or printed from the tool and included as an appendix to this document that is referenced here.

> **Test Case Detail**  
Provide details for each test case/script identified in the Test Case Summary section. There should be a separate detail section for each test case/script. If test case/script information is maintained in an automated tool, the information described in the following sub-sections should be collected for each test case/script. This information may be printed from the tool and included as an appendix to this document that is referenced here. The test case/script details may also be printed in a tabular format to allow groupings of test cases/scripts with similar characteristics to reduce the volume of reported information and make it easier to review the content.

###### APPENDIX A: ACRONYMS
Provide a list of acronyms and associated literal translations used within the document. List the acronyms in alphabetical order using a tabular format as depicted below.

###### APPENDIX B: GLOSSARY
Provide clear and concise definitions for terms used in this document that may be unfamiliar to readers of the document. Terms are to be listed in alphabetical order.

###### APPENDIX C: REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION & STRUCTURE
Summarize the relationship of this document to other relevant documents. Provide identifying information for all documents used to arrive at and/or referenced within this document (e.g., related and/or companion documents, prerequisite documents, relevant technical documentation, etc.).
