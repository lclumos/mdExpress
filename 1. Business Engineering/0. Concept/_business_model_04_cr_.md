###### CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS - CR
The Customer Relationships Building Block describes the types of relationships a company establishes with specific Customer Segments.

A company should clarify the type of relationship it wants to establish with each Customer Segment. Relationships can range from personal to automated. Customer relationships may be driven by the following motivations:
* Customer acquisition
* Customer retention
* Boosting sales (upselling)

There are several categories of Customer Relationships, which may co-exist in a company's relationship with a particular Customer Segment:
* Personal assistance: Derive from human interaction. Customers can communicate with real customer to get help during sales process or after purchase is complete. This may happen on-site at the point of sale, through call centers, by e-mail or through other means.
* Dedicated personal assistance: Involve dedicating a customer representative to an individual client. It represents the deepest and most intimate type of relationship and normally develops over a long period of time.
* Self-service: Maintain no direct relationship with customers. It provides all necessary means for customers to help themselves.
* Automated services: Represent a more sophisticated form of customer self-service with automated processes. Automated services can recognize individual customers and their characteristics, and offer information related to orders or transactions.
* Communities: Utilize user communities to become more involved with customers/prospects and to facilitate connections between community members. Communities allow users to exchange knowledge and companies to better understand their customers.
* Co-creation: Build value by co-work with customers. Some companies engage customers to assist with design of new and innovative products, solicit customers to create content for public consumption.
