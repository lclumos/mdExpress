###### REVENUE STREAMS - R$
The Revenue Streams Building Block represents the cash a company generates from each Customer Segment (costs must be subtracted from revenues to create earnings)

A company must ask itself, for what value is each Customer Segment truly willing to pay? Successfully answering this question allows the firm to generate one or more Revenue Streams from each Customer Segment. Each Revenue Stream may have different pricing mechanisms, such as fixed list prices, bargaining, auctioning, market dependent, volume dependent, or yield management.

A business model can involve two different types of Revenue Streams:
* Transaction revenues resulting from one-time customer payments
* Recurring revenues resulting from ongoing payments to either deliver a Value Proposition to customers or provide post-purchase customer support

Several ways to generate Revenue Streams:
* Asset sale: Derive from selling ownership rights to a physical product.
* Usage fee: Generate from the use of particular services. The more a service is used, the more the customer pays (i.e. telecom, hotel, package delivery service etc.)
* Subscription fees: Generate from selling continuous access to a service (i.e. gym subscriptions, online-game subscription fees etc.)
* Lending/Renting/Leasing: Grant someone exclusive right to use particular asset for a fixed period in return for a fee. Lenders enjoy advantage of recurring revenues. Renters/Lessees have benefits of incurring expenses for only a limited time rather than having to bear the full cost of ownership.
* Licensing: Give customers permission to use protected intellectual property in exchange for licensing fees. Licensing allows right-holders to generate revenues from their property without having to manufacture a product or commercialize a service (i.e. media industry where content owners retain copyright while selling usage licenses to third parties etc.)
* Brokerage fees: Derive from intermediation services performed on behalf of two or more parties (i.e. credit card provides earn revenues by taking a percentage of the value of each sales transactions executed between credit card merchants and customers)
* Advertising: Result from fees for advertising a particular product, service, or brand (i.e. media industry, event organizers, software and services industry etc.)

Pricing Mechanisms - Fixed Menu Pricing (Predefined prices are based on static variables)
* List price: Fixed prices for individual products, services, or other Value Propositions
* Product feature dependent: Price depends on the number or quality of Value Proposition features
* Customer segment dependent: Price depends on the type and characteristic of a Customer Segment
* Volume dependent: Price as a function of the quantity purchased
Pricing Mechanisms - Dynamic Pricing (Prices change based on market conditions)
* Negotiation: Price negotiated between two or more partners depending on negotiation power and/or negotiation skills
* Yield management: Price depends on inventory and time of purchase (normally used for perishable resources such as hotel rooms or airline seats)
* Real-time-market: Price is established dynamically based on supply and demand
* Auctions: Price determined by outcome of competitive bidding
