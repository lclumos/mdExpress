###### RECOVERY TEST
Activity of testing how well the application is able to recover from crashes, hardware failures and other similar problems.

verify app under test in terms of its ability to withstand and recover from possible failures caused by software errors, hardware failures, or communication problems

###### TS1: verifications
- [ ] ID1: verify effective recovery of app after unforeseen crash scenarios
- [ ] ID1: ensure process of data recovery after a break in connection
- [ ] ID1: test recovery after system failure or transaction failure
- [ ] ID1: verify ability of app to process transactions in event of power failure (low battery, incorrect app shutdown etc.)

###### TS2: others
- [ ] ID1: crash recovery and transaction interruptions
- [ ] ID1: validate effective app recovery situation post unexpected interruption/crash scenarios
- [ ] ID1: verify how the app handles transaction during a power failure
- [ ] ID1: validate process where connection is suspended, system needs to re-establish for recovering data
