### BUSINESS MODEL DESIGN

###### CUSTOMER INSIGHTS

We should view business model through customers eyes. This does not mean customer thinking is the only place from which to start an innovation initiative, but that we should include the customer perspective when evaluating a business model.

The challenge is to develop a sound understanding of customers on which to base business model design choices. This is to develop a deeper understanding of customers rather than just asking them what they want.

Another challenge lies in knowing which customers to heed and which customers to ignore. A number of business model innovations have succeeded because they satisfied the unmet needs of new customers.

The tool is to use (Customer) Empathy Map, in which we first to imagine all Customer Segments to serve, then choose certain group of promising candidates, for profiling exercise.
* What does she see? Describe what the customer sees in her environment.
* What does she hear? Describe how the environment influences the customer.
* What does she really think and feel? Try to sketch out what goes on in your customer's mind.
* What does she say and do? Imagine what the customer might say, or how she might behave in public.
* What is the customer's pain?
* What does the customer gain?

###### IDEATION

Mapping an existing business model is one thing, designing a new and innovative business model is another. What is needed is a creative process for generating a large number of business model ideas and successfully isolating the best ones.

Traditionally most industries were characterized by a dominant business model, this practice has changed radically. One challenge we face when trying to create new business model options is ignoring the status quo and suspending concerns over operational issues so that we can generate truly new ideas.

Business model innovation is not about looking back because the past indicates little about what is possible in terms of future business models. Business model innovation is not about looking for competitors, since business model innovation is not about copying or benchmarking but about creating new mechanisms to create value and derive revenues. Rather, business model innovation is about challenging orthodoxies to design original models that meet unsatisfied, new, or hidden customer needs.

Ideation has two main phases: idea generation, where quantity matters, and (2) synthesis, in which ideas are discussed, combined, and narrowed down to a small number of viable options.

There are several starting points to generate ideas for innovative business models, (1) epicenters of business model innovation using the Business Model Canvas, and (2) 'what-if' questions.

Epicenters of Business Model Innovation: Ideas for business model innovation can come from anywhere, and each of the nine business model building blocks can be a starting point. We can distinguish four epicenters of business model innovation: resource-driven, offer-driven, customer-driven, and finance-driven.
* Resource-driven: Originate from an organization's existing infrastructure or partnerships to expand or transform the business model.
* Offer-driven: Create new value propositions that affect other business model building blocks.
* Customer-driven: Base on customer needs, facilitated access, or increased convenience.
* Finance-driven: Driven by new revenue streams, pricing mechanisms, or reduced cost structures.
* Multiple-epicenter driven: Driven by multiple epicenters can have significant impact on several other building blocks.

'What-If' Questions: We often have trouble conceiving innovative business models because we are held back in our thinking by the status quo. One way to overcome this problem is to challenge conventional assumptions with "what-if" questions.

The Ideation Process:
* Team Composition: Is our team sufficiently diverse to generate fresh business model ideas? Members should be diverse in terms of seniority, age, experience level, business unit represented, customer knowledge, and professional expertise.
* Immersion: Which elements must we study before generating business model ideas? Team should go through an immersion phase, which could include general research, studying customers or prospects, scrutinizing new technologies, or assessing existing business models.
* Expanding: What innovations can we imagine for each business model building block? During this phase, th team expands as many ideas as possible. Each of the nine business model building blocks can serve as a starting point. The goal of this phase is quantity, not quality.
* Criteria Section: What are the most important criteria for prioritizing our business model ideas? After expanding ideas and the rage of possible solutions, the team should define criteria for reducing the number of ideas. The criteria will be specific to the context of your business, buy could include things such as estimated implementation time, revenue potential, possible customer resistance, and impact on competitive advantage.
* Prototyping: What does the complete business model for each shortlisted idea look like? The shortlist should be three to five potential business model innovations. Use the Business Model Canvas to sketch out and discuss each idea as a business model prototype.
