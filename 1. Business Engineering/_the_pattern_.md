### BUSINESS MODEL PATTERN

###### UNBUNDLING BUSINESS MODEL

There are 3 fundamentally different types of businesses: (1) Customer Relationship businesses, (2) Product Innovation businesses, and (3) Infrastructure businesses. Each type has different economic, competitive, and cultural imperatives.

Customer Relationship businesses find and acquire customers and build relationships with them.
Product Innovation businesses develop new and attractive products and services.
Infrastructure businesses build and manage platforms for high volume, repetitive tasks.

The three types may co-exist within a single corporation, but ideally they are unbundled into separate entities in order to avoid conflicts or undesirable trade-offs. The company should focus on one of three value disciplines: operational excellence, product leadership, or customer intimacy. Because each type of business is driven by different factors, they can conflict withs each other or produce undesirable trade-offs within the same organization.

###### THE LONG TAIL BUSINESS MODEL

Long tail business models are about selling less of more, as they focus on offering a large number of niche products, each of which sells relatively infrequently. Aggregate sales of niche items can be as lucrative as the traditional model whereby a small number of bestsellers account for most revenues. Long tail business models require low inventory costs and strong platforms to make niche content readily available to interested buyers.

This model describes the shift in selling a small number of "hit" items in large volumes toward selling a very large number of niche items, each in relatively small quantities.

Three related economic triggers gave rise to this phenomenon, specifically in media industry:
* Democratization of tools of production: Falling technology costs gave individuals access to tools that were expensive in the past.
* Democratization of distribution: The Internet has made digital content distribution a commodity, and dramatically lowered inventory, communications, and transaction costs.
* Falling search costs to connect supply with demand: Real challenge of selling niche content is finding interested potential buyers. Powerful search and recommendation engines, user ratings, and communities of interest have made this much easier.

###### MULTI-SIDED PLATFORMS

Multi-sided platforms bring together two or more distinct but interdependent groups of customers. Such platforms are of value to one group of customers only if the other groups of customers are also present.

The platform creates value by facilitating interactions between different groups. A multi-sided platform grows in value to the extent that it attracts more users.

Multi-sided business creates value as intermediaries by connecting these groups. The key is that the platform must attract and serve all groups simultaneously in order to create value.

Multi-sided platforms usually subsidize Customer Segment. The business often decides to lure one segment to the platform with an inexpensive or free Value Proposition in order to subsequently attract users of other sides. The business must understand which side to subsidize and how to prize correctly to attract customers.
