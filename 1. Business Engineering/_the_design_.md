### BUSINESS MODEL DESIGN

###### CUSTOMER INSIGHTS

We should view business model through customers eyes. This does not mean customer thinking is the only place from which to start an innovation initiative, but that we should include the customer perspective when evaluating a business model.

The challenge is to develop a sound understanding of customers on which to base business model design choices. This is to develop a deeper understanding of customers rather than just asking them what they want.

Another challenge lies in knowing which customers to heed and which customers to ignore. A number of business model innovations have succeeded because they satisfied the unmet needs of new customers.

The tool is to use (Customer) Empathy Map, in which we first to imagine all Customer Segments to serve, then choose certain group of promising candidates, for profiling exercise.
* What does she see? Describe what the customer sees in her environment.
* What does she hear? Describe how the environment influences the customer.
* What does she really think and feel? Try to sketch out what goes on in your customer's mind.
* What does she say and do? Imagine what the customer might say, or how she might behave in public.
* What is the customer's pain?
* What does the customer gain?
