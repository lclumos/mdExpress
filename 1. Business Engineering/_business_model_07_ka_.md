###### KEY ACTIVITIES - KA
The Key Activities Building Block describes the most important things a company must do to make its business model work.

Every business model calls for a number of Key Activities. These are the most important actions a company must take to operate successfully. Like Key Resources, they are required to create and offer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain Customer Relationships, and earn revenues. Like Key Resources, Key Activities differ depending on business model type. For software maker, Key Activities include software development. For PC manufacturer, Key Activities include supply chain management.

Categories of Key Activities:
* Production: Relate to designing, making, and delivering a product in substantial quantities and/or of superior quality. Production activity dominates the business models of manufacturing firms.
* Problem solving: Relate to coming up with new solutions to individual customer problems. The operations of consultancies, hospitals, and other service organizations are typically dominated by problem solving activities. Their business models call for activities such as knowledge management and continuous training.
* Platform/Network: Derive from business models designed for a platform (i.e. networks, matchmaking, software etc.) eBay's business model requires that the company continually develop and maintain its platform: the website at eBay.com.. Microsoft's business model requires managing the interface between other vendor's software and its Windows operating system platform. Key Activities in this category relate to platform management, service provisioning, and platform promotion.
