###### APPENDIX G: NOTES TO THE INSTRUCTION  
This document is a template for creating a Test Case Specification for a given investment or project. The final document should be delivered in an electronically searchable format. The Test Case Specification should stand on its own with all elements explained and acronyms spelled out for reader/reviewers, including reviewers outside CMS who may not be familiar with CMS projects and investments.  
This template includes instructions, boilerplate text, and fields. The developer should note that:  
Each section provides instructions or describes the intent, assumptions, and context for content included in that section. Instructional text appears in blue italicized font throughout this template.  
Instructional text in each section should be replaced with information specific to the particular investment.  Some text and tables are provided as boilerplate examples of wording and formats that may be used or modified as appropriate.  
When using this template, follow these steps:
1.	Table captions and descriptions are to be placed left-aligned, above the table.
2.	Modify any boilerplate text, as appropriate, to your specific investment.
3.	Do not delete any headings. If the heading is not applicable to the investment, enter “Not Applicable” under the heading.
4.	All documents must be compliant with Section 508 requirements.
5.	Figure captions and descriptions are to be placed left-aligned, below the figure. All figures must have an associated tag providing appropriate alternative text for Section 508 compliance.
6.	Delete this “Notes to the Author/Template Instructions” page and all instructions to the author before finalizing the initial draft of the document.
