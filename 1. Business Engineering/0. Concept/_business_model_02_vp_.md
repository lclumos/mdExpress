###### VALUE PROPOSITIONS - VP
The Value Propositions Building Block describes the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific Customer Segment.

Value Proposition solves customer problems and satisfies customer needs. Each Value Proposition consists of a selected bundle of products and/or services that caters to the requirements of a specific Customer Segment. The Value Proposition is an aggregation, or bundle, of benefits that a company offers customers. Certain Value Propositions may be innovative and represent a new or disruptive offer. Others may be similar to existing market offers, but with added features and attributes.

Value Proposition creates value for Customer Segment through a distinct mix of elements. Values may be quantitative (price, speed of service etc.) or qualitative (design, customer experience etc.)

Certain elements to be considered when create value propositions:
* Newness: Provide goods and services that are new and there is no similar offering, usually technology related.
* Performance: Increase existing product or service performance to provide better experience to customers.
* Customization: Tailor products and services to specific needs of individual customers or Customer Segment.
* GTD: Create value by simply helping customers to get certain jobs done.
* Design: Provide superior design and hence usage experience to customers.
* Brand: Deliver value to customers as they find value in royal branding products and/or services.
* Price: Offer similar value at lower price to satisfy needs of price-sensitive Customer Segments. Low cost principle must be integrated tightly to the enterprise business strategy.
* Cost Reduction: Help customers reduce their costs in order to increase values.
* Risk Reduction: Provide goods and/or services that can reduce risk for customers.
* Accessibility: Make products and/or services available to customers who previously lacked access to them (i.e. provide private jet services, mutual funds etc.)
* Convenience & Usability: Make things more convenient and easier to use can create substantial value.
