###### SECURITY TEST
Process to reveal flaws in security mechanisms of information system that protect data and maintain functionality as intended.

Security requirement may include specific elements of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, availability, authorization and non-repudiation.

aim to check security of app, analyze risks associated with providing approach to application protection, hackers, viruses, unauthorized access to sensitive data  
ensure that app data and network security requirements are met as per guidelines  

###### TS1: verifications
- [ ] ID1: data of users of the app (logins, passwords, bank card numbers) are protected from network attacks
- [ ] ID1: app security system requires strong password and does not allow attacker to seize passwords of other users
- [ ] ID1: ensure application does not give access to sensitive content or functionality without proper authentication
- [ ] ID1: protect the app against attacks of sql injection type
- [ ] ID1: protect the app against network from DoS attacks
- [ ] ID1: protect the app fromm malicious attacks on clients
- [ ] ID1: protect system from malicious implementations when program is running
- [ ] ID1: provide session management to protect information from unauthorized users
- [ ] ID1: prevent possible malicious consequences of file caching
- [ ] ID1: examine user files and prevent their possible harmful effects
- [ ] ID1: analyze interaction of system files, identify and correct vulnerabilities
- [ ] ID1: prevent possible malicious actions of cookies
- [ ] ID1: validate that app is able to withstand brute force attack
- [ ] ID1: validate whether app is not permitting attacker to access sensitive content or functionality without proper authentication
- [ ] ID1: validate that app has a strong password protection system
- [ ] ID1: app does not permit attacker to obtain, change or recover another users' password
- [ ] ID1: validate that app does not suffer from insufficient session expiration
- [ ] ID1: identify dynamic dependencies and take measures to prevent any attacker from accessing vulnerabilities
- [ ] ID1: prevent from sql injection related attacks
- [ ] ID1: ensure whether certificates are validated
- [ ] ID1: protect app and network from denial of service attacks
- [ ] ID1: analyze data storage and data validation requirements
- [ ] ID1: enable session management for preventing unauthorized users to access unsolicited information
- [ ] ID1: check if any cryptography code is broken and ensure that it is repaired
- [ ] ID1: validate whether business logic implementation is secured from any attack outside
- [ ] ID1: analyze file system interation, detemine vulnerability and correct these problems
- [ ] ID1: validate protocol handlers trying to reconfigure default landing page for app using malicious iframe
- [ ] ID1: protect against malicious client side injections
- [ ] ID1: protect against malicious runtime injections
- [ ] ID1: investigate file caching and prevent any malicious possibilities
- [ ] ID1: prevent from insecure data storage in keyboard cache of the app
- [ ] ID1: investigate cookies and preventing malicious deeds from cookies
- [ ] ID1: provide regular audits for data protection analysis
- [ ] ID1: investigate custom created files and preventing any malicious deeds from custom created files
- [ ] ID1: prevent from buffer overflows and memory corruption cases
- [ ] ID1: analyze different data streams and prevent any vulnerability
