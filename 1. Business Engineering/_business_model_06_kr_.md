###### KEY RESOURCES - KR
The Key Resources Building Block describes the most important assets required to make a business model work.

Every business model requires Key Resources. These resources allow an enterprise to create and offer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain relationships with Customer Segments, and earn revenues. Different Key Resources are needed depending on the type of business model.

Key Resources can be physical, financial, intellectual, or human. Key Resources can be owned or leased by the company or acquired from key partners.

Categories of Key Resources:
* Physical: Include physical assets such as manufacturing facilities, buildings, vehicles, machines, systems, point-of-sales systems, and distribution networks.
* Intellectual: Include brands, proprietary knowledge, patents and copyrights, partnerships, and customer databases are increasingly important components of a strong business model (i.e. branding name, software intellectual property)
* Human: Derive human resources to enterprise, but people are particularly prominent in certain business models, like knowledge-intensive or creative industries.
* Financial: Derive financial resource and/or financial guarantees, such as cash, lines of credit, or a stock option pool for hiring key employees.
